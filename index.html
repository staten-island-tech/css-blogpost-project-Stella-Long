        Mango sago is a creamy, tropical Asian dessert that combines sweet
        mangoes with chewy tapioca (sago) pearls and coconut milk. This
        refreshing, chilled dish is widely popular in Hong Kong, and variations
        are found throughout Southeast Asia, including in Singapore, Malaysia,
        and the Philippines.

        A pineapple bun, or bo lo bao in Cantonese, is a sweet Hong Kong pastry
        with a soft, fluffy bread and a signature crunchy, golden-brown crust.
        Despite its name, the traditional version does not contain pineapple;
        it's named for the decorative, cracked pattern of the topping, which
        resembles the skin of a pineapple.

        An egg tart is a small, sweet dessert consisting of a pastry crust
        filled with a delicate egg custard. While there are regional variations,
        the most widely known versions originate from Portuguese and Cantonese
        culinary traditions. These desserts are typically served at Chinese
        bakeries and dim sum restaurants.
