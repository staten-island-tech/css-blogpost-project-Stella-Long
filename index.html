          Mango sago is a creamy, tropical Asian dessert that combines sweet
          mangoes with chewy tapioca (sago) pearls and coconut milk. This
          refreshing, chilled dish is widely popular in Hong Kong, and
          variations are found throughout Southeast Asia, including in
          Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

        <p>
          Gelato is a dense, rich Italian frozen dessert, translating to "ice
          cream" in Italian, but with a lower fat content (4â€“9%) than American
          ice cream because it uses more milk than cream and less air, achieved
          by slower churning. This results in a smoother, more velvety texture,
          and since it's served at a warmer temperature, it has a more intense
          flavor that melts quickly in the mouth.

        <p>
          Strawberry cheesecake is a classic dessert featuring a creamy, velvety
          cheesecake filling with a buttery crust, typically graham cracker, and
          is topped with fresh, ripe strawberries or a sweet strawberry sauce or
          glaze. It offers a delightful balance of rich, smooth cheesecake
          flavor with the bright, fresh taste of strawberries, creating a
          dessert that is both luscious and refreshing.
